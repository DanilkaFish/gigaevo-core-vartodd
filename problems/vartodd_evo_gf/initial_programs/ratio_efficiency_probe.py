"""Score reduction per unit of bucket work, a ratio the weight vector could not express.

The classic score is a weighted sum, so it can reward large reductions and
penalize large buckets, but it cannot ask for reduction *relative to* the bucket
it came from. In the terminal band, where researched z counts grow huge and
acceptance collapses, "which candidate pays for its search cost" is a different
question from "which candidate reduces most".

The ratio lives in the finalization score, which runs once per merged
candidate; exploration stays a weighted sum so the pool fills at the usual
rate.

Cost note: exploration still reads k.nbucket for its ordinary linear bucket
term, and any z-varying knob there costs the inner z search its reduction-only
fast path -- measured at roughly 4-5x per policy step. If that proves too
expensive for the rank it buys, dropping the k.nbucket term from exploration
recovers it without touching the ratio.
